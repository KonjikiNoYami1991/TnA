# TnA - Tanoshimi no Autohardsubber

Simple, yet almost automatic, autohardsubber from [Tanoshimi no Sekai Fansub](https://tnsfansub.com/), written in C# .NET 4.8.

## Building

This solution requires a C# builder for Windows.\
For example, [Visual Studio Community 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/community/), even without registration.\
No need to use Professional or Enterprise edition, but you can.

## Requirements for building

- [FFmpeg by Zeranoe](https://ffmpeg.zeranoe.com/builds/) static for Windows (automatically downloaded)
- [SevenZipSharp](https://www.nuget.org/packages/SevenZipSharp.Net45/) (no need to install 7z)
- [MediaInfoNet](https://www.nuget.org/packages/MediaInfoNet/) (no need to install MediaInfo)
- [FFmpeg Output Wrapper DLL](https://github.com/KonjikiNoYami1991/FFmpegOutputWrapperNET) (for encoding progress)
- [mkvmerge.exe from MKVtoolnix for Windows](https://mkvtoolnix.download/) (preferably x86 for compatibility with x86 systems)

## Features
- Only in italian language, for now.
- No administrator rights required.
- Can be placed in a netfolder and used with multiple PCs (not recommended).
- Supported file formats:
  - MKV (this is the only supported format for autohardsubbing)
  - MP4 
  - M2TS (only for MKV remux)
  - TS (only for MKV remux)
  - AVI
  - MOV 
  - RMVB (not tested)
  - OGM (not tested)
  - FLV (not tested)
  - VOB
  - MPG/MPEG
  - 3GP (not tested)
  - M4V (not tested)
- Automatic extraction of fonts and subtitle track from MKV files (no need to install fonts).
- Integrated updater.
- Autodeinterlacing when needed with [YADIF](https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html#yadif-1), mode=0 for spatial check without bobbing (only if TFF or BFF are detected, otherwise disabled).\
This is not the best way for deinterlacing, but it's very fast and simple to use.
- Instead of xyVSfilter (not included in FFmpeg), it uses [LIBASS](https://github.com/libass/libass) for Advanced Substation Alpha subtitles and generally works well.
- Format selection when adding an entire folder.
- Clipboard monitoring, similar to JDownloader.\
By activating this, you can just copy files and folder from File Explorer and they will be automatically added, following the formats choices.
- Settings save in .ini file.
- Automatic removing of source file after a correct conversion (this feature has to be tested, because files seem removed, but they're not).
- Pause/resume conversion.
- SendTo link in Windows SendTo men√π can be created or removed.
- Possibility to choose one action after conversion of all listed files.
- Can be restored to initial settings.
- Audio track copying instead of re-encoding if destination audio is equal to source.
- Remuxing files to MKV (with mkvmerge, ignoring all other settings) and to MP4 files.\
MP4 remux only supports:
  - H.264/H.265/XviD/DivX/MPEG 1-2-4 video streams
  - AAC/AC-3/MP3/ALAC audio streams
  - No subtitles of any kind, except TimedText (very rare and only used for 3GP).
  - Any other stream not listed above will be re-encoded according to the other parameters.
- All videos will be resized if selected resolution of destination is lower than source, considering aspect ratio. It'll never do any upscale.\
For example, a video source with resolution 1280x720 will never be upscaled to 1600x900, even selecting 900p for resolution.\
So, don't try to.
- Because there are videos with odd resolution, such as 1555x813 or one between width and height, because every compatibility profile is designed to reach standard encoding, this application will recalculate the destination resolution.\
For example, if width is odd, it will be lowered by 1, the same for height.
- While aspect ratio is greater than or equal to 1,333 (4:3), width will be used for resizing.\
Instead, height will be used.


## Hardware requirements
### Minimum
 - OS: Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x86/x64.
 - CPU: Intel Core 2 Quad, 2,00 GHz x 4.
 - RAM: 4 GB DDR2 (better have DDR3).
 - GPU: any.
 - SSD/HDD: HDD, better yet with SSD.

### Recommended
 - OS: Windows 7/8/8.1/10 x86/x64.
 - CPU: the faster, the better.
 - RAM: 8 GB DDR4.
 - GPU: any.
 - SSD/HDD: HDD, better yet with SSD.

Actually, any hardware will be fine (excepted RAM) because it's just a matter of how much time is needed to process video files. Obviously, process will be slow with slow PCs.
For example, a video 1080p with 23,976 fps, duration of 24 mins, encoded at below-medium quality, reaches 10-12 fps during conversion: PC is slow or not suitable for video encoding, but time needed is still acceptable.
Keep in mind that deinterlacing slows down encoding speed.

## Explanation of parameters
There are many parameters that can be setted before starting encoding, described below.

## Usage

- Drag&drop files and folders, use buttons or paste files and folders from system clipboard.
- Choose one among compatibility profiles, resolutions (height), quality profiles, aubtitle modes.
- Click on Play button and wait. Destination files will be in the same folder of source files, never overwritten.

```bash
-
```
